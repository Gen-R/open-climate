# Project Open Climate

📗/🌍 #openclimate

Initiated: September 2019

Open Climate is a community initiative in response to ‘climate protests’ to provide an actionable ‘framework plan’ for how to transition climate change research publishing from closed to open access publishing in the shortest time possible.

>**Contribute: Help creating lists for a knowledgebase that will be used for content mining and stats on the state of OA publishign in climate change.** Currently Peter Murray-Rust is using the Content Mine software to analyse open publishing repositories to get an up-to-date stats on open access for climate change. To help in this work **dictionaries need building** to carry out the searches as well as **locating repostories to search**. The lists also serve as a way to establish a knowledgebase for the project. As of 4/5 Sept 2019 there is an eLifeSprint, see https://github.com/petermr/climate

An open collaboration between [Peter Murray-Rust](http://www-pmr.ch.cam.ac.uk/wiki/Main_Page) and [*Generation Research*](https://genr.eu/) with an invitation to get involved for the wider public and the open science community.

Based on our [initial research](https://genr.eu/wp/open-climate/) it would appear that climate change research publishing is at levels of less than 30% as of 2016.

## Roadmap

- Create knowledgebase (active)
- Community building (active)
- Planning
- Implementation
- Rinse, repeat

## How to Contribute

The following lists are being created to **help build open access stats and a knowledgebase** to better understand more about the state of open access publishing for climate change sciences and to make a plan for 100% open access publishing ASAP in fields related to climate change.

### Tasks

Please add or edit items for the lists below. Edit the lists over on this [LIVE PAD](https://demo.codimd.org/WnH_pVKuTmSbIic12opyNQ?both) and then we'll copy accross information, or contribute direct to this page, whatever suits you best.
